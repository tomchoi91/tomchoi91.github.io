👋 Hello, my name is **Dongho Choi**. Please call me **Tom**. 😊

🎓 I earned a M.A. in Educational Psychology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (August 2022). I am getting a M.S. in Statistics as well (May 2023).

💼 Currently working as a graduate research assistant at Nebraska Academy for Methodology, Analytics & Psychometrics at UNL. I have participated in more than a dozen projects with a focus on child education and intervention projects. My responsibility in the projects includes, but is not limited to: Data cleaning, data management, statistical analysis, reporting the results, and supporting journal submission by writing and reviewing methods and results.

💻 As for my future, I hope to one day work as a data analyst/statistician/researcher at schools and/or hospitals

🔍 In my free time, I like watching detective dramas.

💪 I have years of experience in educational data and longitudinal data analysis using latent variable models and generalized linear mixed models.
